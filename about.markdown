# About Me

![My Photo](/assets/me.png){:style="width:240px; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:20px;"}

I'm a computer technician, programmer, and community volunteer based in Westerville, Ohio.  
My work blends hands-on troubleshooting with building practical technical solutions — everything from Microsoft 365 automation, PowerShell scripting, Google Workspace integrations, Access/Excel tools, and C++/C#/Python development, to building websites and maintaining digital resources for local groups.

I use this site to publish guides, scripts, and write-ups that I’ve created for clients, community members, and my own projects. Most content is practical, repeatable, and aimed at solving real problems: fixing data issues, automating workflows, building forms/spreadsheets, or helping local nonprofit organizations modernize their digital tools.

## Community & Civic Work

I’m active in several local Champaign County and central-Ohio community efforts, including:

- creating and maintaining directories, forms, and online resources for civic groups  
- building tools for organizations such as historical societies, Lions Clubs, and small nonprofits  
- helping groups adopt modern digital workflows while keeping things simple and low-cost  
- preparing documentation, letters, templates, and research to support transparency and community involvement

These projects regularly appear on this site in the form of templates, letters, legal references, and technical guides.
