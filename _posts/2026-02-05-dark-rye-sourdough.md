## Overview {#overview}

This is a traditional **dark rye sourdough** with deep, earthy flavor, mild tang, and a tight but moist crumb. The formula uses a high percentage of dark rye flour while remaining sliceable and reliable for a home oven.

This bread improves with time and is best baked in a loaf pan.

---

## Flour Profile {#flour-profile}

- **70% dark rye flour**  
- **30% bread flour**

This balance preserves classic rye flavor while preventing a dense or gummy loaf.

---

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

### Levain (build 8–12 hours before mixing)

- 40 g ripe sourdough starter  
- 60 g dark rye flour  
- 60 g water (room temperature)

### Dough

- All of the levain  
- 260 g dark rye flour  
- 120 g bread flour  
- 330 g water (warm, approx. 90°F / 32°C)  
- 10 g salt  
- 1 tbsp molasses or barley malt syrup (optional but traditional)  
- 1 tsp caraway seeds (optional)

**Total hydration:** approximately 85%

## Method {#method}

### Build the Levain {#build-the-levain}

Mix the starter, rye flour, and water until smooth. Cover loosely and ferment at room temperature for 8–12 hours. The levain should be bubbly and aromatic by morning.

---

### Mix the Dough {#mix-the-dough}

1. Combine the water and levain in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.
2. Add the flours, salt, molasses, and caraway seeds.
3. Mix with a spoon or wet hand until fully combined.

The dough will be thick, sticky, and paste-like. This is normal for high-rye doughs.

**Do not knead.** Rye flour contains little gluten and does not benefit from kneading.

---

### Bulk Fermentation {#bulk-fermentation}

- Cover and ferment for **2½–3½ hours** at room temperature.
- Look for a **30–40% rise**, not doubling.
- Small surface cracks are a good indicator of readiness.

---

### Pan and Shape {#pan-and-shape}

1. Lightly oil or line a loaf pan.
2. Scrape the dough into the pan.
3. Smooth the surface with wet hands or a spatula.
4. Optionally dust the top lightly with rye flour.

---

### Final Proof {#final-proof}

- Cover and proof for **1½–2 hours**.
- The dough should dome slightly and show small cracks on the surface.

Avoid over-proofing, as rye dough collapses easily.

---

### Bake {#bake}

1. Preheat oven to **475°F (245°C)**.
2. Introduce steam (tray of hot water or oven-safe spray).
3. Bake for **15 minutes at 475°F**.
4. Reduce temperature to **400°F (205°C)** and bake an additional **40–45 minutes**.

Target internal temperature: **205–210°F**.

Remove the loaf from the pan immediately after baking.

---

### Cooling {#cooling}

Allow the bread to cool **at least 12 hours** before slicing. Rye bread continues to set internally after baking, and slicing early will result in a gummy crumb.

---

## Storage and Flavor Development {#storage}

- Flavor improves after 24 hours.
- Keeps well for **5–7 days** wrapped in linen or paper.
- Excellent toasted after day two.

---

## Variations {#variations}

- **Seeded rye:** Add soaked sunflower or flax seeds.
- **Deli-style rye:** Add 1 tbsp cocoa powder and an extra tablespoon of molasses.
- **Higher rye:** Increase rye flour gradually; 100% rye requires a scald and adjusted fermentation.

---

## Notes {#notes}

This recipe favors structure and reliability while preserving traditional rye character. For best results, use freshly milled or high-quality dark rye flour and allow sufficient curing time before slicing.
