## Overview {#overview}

This is a simple, repeatable sourdough bread you can bake any weeknight.  
It uses **100% natural leavening** (no commercial yeast), works with a typical home oven,  
and assumes you have an active sourdough starter.

- Yield: 1 large loaf (about 800–900 g baked weight)  
- Hydration: ~70%  
- Total time: 8–24 hours (including overnight fermentation option)

---

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

### Baker’s percentages {#bakers-percentages}

- 100% bread flour (or 80% bread flour + 20% whole wheat)
- 70% water (room temp)
- 20% active starter (100% hydration)
- 2% fine sea salt

### For one loaf {#for-one-loaf}

- 450 g bread flour  
- 50 g whole wheat flour (or more bread flour)  
- 350 g water (reserve 20–30 g to add later with salt)  
- 100 g **active** sourdough starter (fed and bubbly)  
- 10 g fine sea salt  

Optional add-ins (fold in during bulk ferment):  
- 30–60 g seeds (sesame, sunflower, flax)  
- 20–40 g oats (lightly toasted)  
- Herbs, roasted garlic, cheese, etc.

## Tools You’ll Need {#tools-youll-need}

- Kitchen scale (highly recommended)  
- Large mixing bowl or dough tub  
- Bench scraper or stiff spatula  
- Proofing basket (banneton) or a bowl lined with a floured towel  
- Razor blade or sharp knife for scoring  
- Dutch oven **or** baking stone/steel with steam tray  
- Parchment paper (optional but helpful)

---

## Step 1: Make Sure Your Starter Is Active {#step-1-starter}

1. Feed your starter 4–8 hours before mixing the dough.  
2. It’s ready when:
   - It has doubled in volume.  
   - It’s full of bubbles.  
   - A small spoonful **floats** in a glass of water (float test).  

If your starter doesn’t pass the float test, feed it again and try later. The bread will rise only as well as your starter.

---

## Step 2: Autolyse (Flour + Water Rest) {#step-2-autolyse}

1. In a large bowl, mix together:
   - 450 g bread flour  
   - 50 g whole wheat flour  
   - 320–330 g of the water (reserve 20–30 g for later)  
2. Mix until no dry bits remain. The dough will look shaggy and rough—this is fine.  
3. Cover and let rest for **30–60 minutes**.

This rest hydrates the flour and kickstarts gluten development, making the dough easier to handle later.

---

## Step 3: Mix in Starter and Salt {#step-3-mix}

1. Add **100 g active starter** to the dough.  
2. Add the remaining **20–30 g water** and **10 g salt**.  
3. Use your hand to pinch and fold the dough until everything is thoroughly combined and the salt is dissolved.

The dough should feel soft, slightly sticky, and more cohesive than before.

---

## Step 4: Bulk Fermentation (First Rise) {#step-4-bulk-fermentation}

Bulk fermentation builds strength and flavor.

### Stretch and folds (first 1–2 hours) {#stretch-and-folds}

For the first **60–90 minutes**, perform **3–4 sets** of stretch-and-folds, about 20–30 minutes apart:

1. With damp hands, grab one edge of the dough, stretch it up, then fold it over the center.  
2. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat 3–4 times until you’ve gone around the dough.  
3. That’s one “set” of folds.

You should notice the dough becoming smoother and more elastic.

### Let it rise {#let-it-rise}

After the last fold, cover and let the dough rest at **75–78°F (24–26°C)** until:

- It has increased in volume by about **50–75%**  
- The surface is slightly domed and jiggly  
- You can see some bubbles at the sides or top

This usually takes **3–5 hours**, depending on temperature and starter strength.

> Cooler kitchen? Expect bulk to take longer. Warmer kitchen? It will go faster.

---

## Step 5: Pre-Shape and Bench Rest {#step-5-pre-shape}

1. Gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  
2. Using a bench scraper, form a loose round by folding the edges toward the center and flipping it seam-side down.  
3. Use gentle tension pulls (drag the dough toward you with the scraper) to create a tight surface.  
4. Let the dough rest, covered with a towel, for **20–30 minutes**.

This “bench rest” relaxes the gluten so you can shape more cleanly.

---

## Step 6: Final Shape {#step-6-final-shape}

Shape as a **boule** (round) or **batard** (oval):

1. Lightly flour the top of the resting dough and flip it over.  
2. Gently stretch it into a rough rectangle.  
3. Fold the bottom third up, the top third down (like a letter), then fold in the sides.  
4. Roll or tighten the dough into a taut ball or log, creating surface tension without tearing.

Place the shaped dough **seam-side up** in a well-floured banneton or towel-lined bowl.

---

## Step 7: Proofing (Second Rise) {#step-7-proofing}

### Option A: Same-day proof {#same-day-proof}

- Cover the basket and let the dough rise at room temperature for **45–90 minutes**.  
- It’s ready when it has slightly puffed, and a light finger poke springs back slowly, leaving a gentle indentation.

### Option B: Overnight cold proof (recommended) {#overnight-proof}

- Cover well and refrigerate for **8–16 hours**.  
- This slows fermentation, builds deeper flavor, and makes the dough easier to score.

You can bake the dough straight from the fridge.

---

## Step 8: Preheat the Oven {#step-8-preheat}

About **45–60 minutes** before baking:

1. Place your Dutch oven (with lid) in the oven.  
2. Preheat to **475°F / 245°C**.

A fully preheated oven and pot are key for good oven spring.

---

## Step 9: Score and Bake {#step-9-bake}

1. Cut a piece of parchment large enough to lift the dough.  
2. Turn the dough out of the basket onto the parchment, now **seam-side down**.  
3. Lightly dust with flour, then score with a sharp razor at a 30–45° angle:
   - One long slash along the top, or  
   - A pattern of smaller cuts if you like.

### Baking with a Dutch oven {#baking-with-dutch-oven}

1. Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven.  
2. Lift the dough (on parchment) into the pot, cover with the lid.  
3. Bake covered for **20 minutes**.  
4. Reduce heat to **450°F / 232°C**, remove the lid, and bake another **20–25 minutes** until:
   - The crust is a deep golden-brown  
   - The internal temperature is around **205–210°F (96–99°C)**

Remove from the pot and cool on a rack for **at least 1 hour** before slicing. The crumb finishes setting as it cools.

## Timing Example (With Overnight Proof) {#timing-example}

- 9:00 am – Feed starter  
- 1:00 pm – Mix flour and water (autolyse)  
- 2:00 pm – Add starter and salt, begin bulk fermentation  
- 2:00–3:30 pm – Stretch-and-folds every 30 minutes  
- 3:30–6:00 pm – Let dough finish bulk rise  
- 6:00 pm – Pre-shape, bench rest 30 minutes  
- 6:30 pm – Final shape, into basket, then fridge  
- Next day 8:00 am – Preheat oven and Dutch oven  
- 9:00 am – Bake, then cool and enjoy

Adjust to your schedule and kitchen temperature.

## Variations and Tips {#variations-and-tips}

- **Higher hydration**: Once you’re comfortable, add 10–20 g more water for a more open crumb.  
- **More whole grains**: Swap up to 30–40% of the flour with whole wheat or rye; you may need a bit more water.  
- **Seeds and mix-ins**: Fold in soaked seeds, chopped nuts, or cheese during the last stretch-and-fold.  
- **Crust control**:
  - Softer crust: Wrap the cooled loaf in a clean towel.  
  - Extra crisp: Let the loaf cool fully on a rack in open air.

If a loaf doesn’t come out perfect, still taste it carefully and note what you like. Small tweaks to fermentation time, temperature, and hydration will quickly dial this into *your* house sourdough.

Happy baking! 🥖
