A practical, everyday guide to using Facebook on desktop and mobile: posting, messaging, groups, pages, Marketplace, and the privacy/security basics that prevent most headaches.

## Quick start checklist {#quick-start-checklist}

1. Turn on **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.
2. Set your default post audience to **Friends** (you can change per post).
3. Review **who can send you friend requests** and **who can look you up**.
4. Learn where **Settings & privacy** lives in the app.
5. Know how to **block**, **report**, and **mute/unfollow**.

---

## Facebook basics: what the main areas do {#facebook-basics}

- **Home / Feed**: posts from friends, pages, groups, plus recommendations.
- **Profile**: your identity and your timeline.
- **Friends**: your connections and friend requests.
- **Pages**: businesses/organizations/creators you follow.
- **Groups**: communities around topics; can be public or private.
- **Messenger**: direct messages, calls, group chats, message requests.
- **Marketplace**: local buying/selling.
- **Notifications**: likes, comments, tags, invites—your activity inbox.
- **Settings & privacy**: account security, privacy controls, preferences.

---

## Account setup and security {#account-setup-and-security}

### Create/verify your account {#create-verify-account}

- Use an email address or phone number you control long-term.
- Add a name and photo people recognize (helps real friends find you).
- Verify email/phone if prompted.

### Password + 2FA (do this first) {#password-and-2fa}

- Use a long passphrase (12–16+ characters) and **don’t reuse** it elsewhere.
- Enable **2FA** (authenticator app is best; SMS is better than nothing).
- Make sure recovery options are current (email/phone).

### Spot suspicious activity {#spot-suspicious-activity}

Red flags:
- Unexpected password reset emails
- Login alerts from places you’ve never been
- Friends saying they got weird messages “from you”

If you suspect compromise:
- Change password immediately
- Log out of other sessions/devices (in security settings)
- Review recent emails and app permissions

---

## Privacy: set defaults, then spot-check {#privacy}

Facebook’s wording changes over time, but the core questions don’t:

1. **Who can see my stuff?**
2. **Who can contact me?**
3. **How discoverable am I?**

### Audience controls (Public vs Friends) {#audience-controls}

Every post has an **audience selector**. Common options:

- **Public**: anyone can see (including non-friends).
- **Friends**: only your friends.
- **Friends except…**: exclude specific people.
- **Specific friends**: only selected friends.
- **Only me**: private.
- **Custom**: mix inclusions/exclusions.

Best default for most people: **Friends**.

### Limit who can find you {#limit-who-can-find-you}

In **Privacy** settings, look for controls like:

- Who can send you friend requests
- Who can look you up by email/phone
- Search engine linking to your profile

### Review older posts {#review-older-posts}

If you’ve been on Facebook for years, use the option that **limits past posts** (often converts older “Public” posts to “Friends”). It’s a one-time cleanup that pays off.

### Tagging and timeline review {#tagging-and-timeline-review}

Enable review tools so you approve:

- Posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your profile
- Tags people add to your posts/photos

### Block, restrict, unfollow, mute {#block-restrict-unfollow-mute}

- **Unfollow**: stay friends but stop seeing their posts.
- **Mute**: hide posts/stories temporarily (often 30 days).
- **Restrict**: limits what they see; messages may be filtered (varies).
- **Block**: full separation—no profile, tags, or messages.

Rule of thumb: if someone makes you uneasy, **block** (you don’t owe them access).

---

## Posting: text, photos, video, stories {#posting}

### Create a post {#create-a-post}

1. Start from **Home** or your **Profile**.
2. Write text, add media (photo/video), optionally add location.
3. Choose **audience** (Public/Friends/Custom).
4. Post.

Tip: If you accidentally post to Public, you can often **change the audience after posting**.

### Photos and albums {#photos-and-albums}

- Use albums to organize (Trips, Family, Projects).
- Remember: **profile and cover photos may be more visible** than regular posts.
- Avoid posting images that show sensitive details (IDs, mail, keys, license plates).

### Stories vs posts {#stories-vs-posts}

- **Stories**: temporary (often ~24 hours).
- **Posts**: stay until deleted.

Use stories for quick updates; use posts for things you want searchable later.

### Edit or delete a post {#edit-or-delete-a-post}

- Open the post → menu (often **•••**) → **Edit** or **Delete/Move to trash**.

---

## Comments, reactions, and etiquette {#comments-and-etiquette}

- React (Like/Love/etc.) for quick support.
- Comment when you can add something useful or kind.
- If a thread turns hostile: **don’t escalate**. Mute it, or take it to DM, or disengage.
- Don’t share private info in public comments (phone, address, account numbers).

---

## Friends and following {#friends-and-following}

### Handling friend requests {#friend-requests}

Before accepting:
- Do you recognize them?
- Do you have real mutual friends?
- Does the profile look empty/new/odd?

If you’re not sure: **ignore/delete** the request.

### Unfriend vs unfollow {#unfriend-vs-unfollow}

- **Unfollow** reduces feed clutter without drama.
- **Unfriend** ends the connection.

### Friend lists (optional but powerful) {#friend-lists}

If you post to different audiences, friend lists help:
- Family
- Close friends
- Work/community

Then use **Specific friends** / **Friends except…** when posting.

---

## Messenger: chats, calls, and message requests {#messenger}

### Start a chat {#start-a-chat}

- Open Messenger → search a name → send a message.
- You can share photos, voice notes, links, and location (use location sparingly).

### Message requests (from non-friends) {#message-requests}

Non-friends often land in **Message requests**:
- Spam/scams: **don’t reply** → **block/report**
- Legit: accept the request and respond

### Group chats {#group-chats}

Best practices:
- Name the group and set expectations (topic, tone, urgency).
- Use reactions instead of flooding the chat.
- Don’t share someone else’s number/address without permission.

---

## Groups: joining, posting, staying safe {#groups}

### Pick the right group {#pick-the-right-group}

Check:
- Public vs private
- Rules and moderation
- Recent activity (is it alive?)
- Spam level (scroll the last week)

### Post in a group {#post-in-a-group}

- Read pinned posts and rules first.
- Provide context: location, budget, what you tried, what you need.
- If asking for help: include photos and clear questions.

### Safety for local groups {#local-group-safety}

Avoid posting:
- Your home address
- Your daily schedule
- Sensitive documents/photos (IDs, bills, prescriptions)

---

## Pages: businesses and creators {#pages}

- **Follow** a page to see updates.
- If you don’t want to miss it, use **Favorites/See first** (if available).
- If a page turns spammy: unfollow, hide, or report.

---

## Marketplace: buy and sell safely {#marketplace}

### Buying tips {#buying-tips}

- Prefer in-person pickup in a **public place**.
- Check item condition carefully; ask for more photos.
- Avoid “too good to be true” prices and weird payment demands.

### Selling tips {#selling-tips}

- Meet in public; consider “safe exchange zones” near police stations.
- Don’t share personal info beyond what’s needed.
- Use clear photos and an honest description.
- If a buyer pressures you to ship or pay outside Marketplace: walk away.

---

## Troubleshooting common issues {#troubleshooting}

### “Why am I seeing weird stuff in my feed?” {#weird-feed}

- You may be following pages/groups you forgot about.
- Use **Unfollow**, **Snooze**, or **Hide** on unwanted content.
- Review your **Favorites** and **Following** lists.

### “People I don’t know are messaging me” {#unknown-messages}

- Check **message request** settings.
- Restrict who can contact you where possible.
- Block/report repeat offenders.

### “I posted something wrong—what now?” {#posted-wrong}

- Edit the post or delete it.
- If it’s sensitive, also check if it was shared or screenshotted (assume it might have been).

---

## Healthy habits {#healthy-habits}

- Turn off non-essential notifications.
- Don’t argue with strangers; protect your energy.
- Treat “viral” posts skeptically—verify before sharing.
- Re-check privacy settings a couple times a year.

---

## Glossary {#glossary}

- **Audience**: who can see a post.
- **Feed**: your scrolling timeline of posts.
- **Page**: public presence for an org/creator.
- **Group**: community space; may be private.
- **Message request**: DM from non-friend.
- **2FA**: a second login step (best defense against account takeovers).
