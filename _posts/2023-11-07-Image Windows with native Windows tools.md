## Image Windows with native Windows tools

While many third-party tools exist to backup your PC, a Windows Image Backup created using the Microsoft tools has several advantages:

1. It's free, and already available on your computer
2. If the system crashes or the hard disk fails, you can completely restore the computer from Windows Recovery Mode
3. The backup itself can be mounted and accessed just like a disk drive, e.g., everything can be accessed in whatever computer the backup is later attached to.

There are many defferent ways to do this, but the result is always the creation of a WindowsImageBackup folder that contains everything needed to restore the computer operating system.
