## 🥩 Texas-Style Smoked Brisket Guide

A complete, step-by-step walkthrough for perfectly tender, competition-level brisket — from ingredient sourcing to slicing.

---

### 1. 🛒 Gather Ingredients and Supplies

**Main Ingredient**
- **1 whole packer brisket (12–16 lb)** — ideally *USDA Choice* or *Prime*.
  - **Where to buy:** Costco, Sam’s Club, or a trusted local butcher (ask for a *packer cut*, not trimmed “flat only”).

---

**Seasoning Binder**
- **Yellow mustard** — standard French’s or Heinz brand.

---

**Dry Rub Seasoning Mix**

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Coarse kosher salt | ½ cup | Morton or Diamond Crystal; coarse grain helps bark formation. |
| **16-mesh black pepper** | ½ cup | Key to that authentic coarse Texas bark. |
| Garlic powder | 2 tbsp | Adds savory depth. |
| Optional: paprika or chili powder | 1 tbsp | Slight color and mild heat. |

**Where to buy 16-mesh black pepper**
- **Online:** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Spiceology](https://www.spiceology.com/), or [WebstaurantStore](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/).  
  Search “16-mesh coarse black pepper.”
- **Local suppliers:** GFS, Restaurant Depot, or Smart Foodservice.  
  Ask for “coarse ground pepper, 16-mesh.”

---

**Spritz Solution**
- 1 cup apple cider vinegar  
- 1 cup water  
- Mix in a clean spray bottle.

---

**Wrapping & Tools**
- Heavy-duty aluminum foil *or* food-grade pink butcher paper  
- 2–3 tbsp beef broth or rendered tallow (for wrapping)  
- Meat thermometer/probe  
- Cooler or warming oven (for holding phase)

---

### 2. 🔪 Trim and Prepare the Brisket

1. Trim away hard surface fat, leaving **¼-inch fat cap**.  
2. Square thin edges for even cooking.  
3. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels.

---

### 3. 🧈 Apply Mustard Binder & Seasoning

1. Lightly coat brisket with **yellow mustard** (2–3 tbsp total).  
2. Combine dry rub ingredients in a bowl.  
3. Shake evenly across all sides; press gently to adhere.  
4. Let rest **30–60 minutes** at room temperature until surface turns tacky.

---

### 4. 🔥 Smoker Setup

- **Temperature:** 225–250 °F steady  
- **Wood:** Oak or hickory (blend with cherry or apple for color)  
- **Placement:**  
  - *Offset smoker:* fat cap **up**  
  - *Pellet/electric smoker:* fat cap **down**  
- Insert thermometer probe into thickest part of flat.

---

### 5. 🌫️ Smoking Phase (Unwrapped)

- Smoke for **6–8 hours** or until internal temp hits **165 °F**.  
- Spritz every 1½–2 hours with the vinegar mix.  
- Bark should be dark mahogany and firm before wrapping.

---

### 6. 🧻 Wrapping the Brisket (“Texas Crutch”)

1. Wrap tightly in **foil or pink butcher paper** once internal temp is **165–170 °F**.  
2. Add **2–3 tbsp broth or tallow** inside.  
3. Return to smoker and maintain **250 °F** chamber temperature.

---

### 7. 🌡️ Finishing the Cook

- Continue smoking until internal temp reaches **190–203 °F**.  
- Check tenderness: probe should slide in *like warm butter*.  
- Focus on feel more than temperature.

---

### 8. 🧊 Resting & Holding Phase

1. Remove from smoker; rest **30 minutes** (still wrapped) on counter to stop carryover heat.  
2. Move to a **150 °F warmer or insulated cooler**.  
3. Hold for **4–5 hours** for optimal tenderness — up to **8 hours** if sealed well.  
4. Internal temp will stabilize around **145–155 °F**, ideal for slicing.

---

### 9. 🔪 Slicing & Serving

1. Unwrap and retain juices.  
2. Slice **against the grain** — rotate when moving from flat to point.  
3. Cut slices about **¼ inch thick**.  
4. Serve with juices or a drizzle of warm tallow.

### 🕓 Suggested Timeline (14 lb Brisket @ 250 °F)

| Step | Duration | Target Temp | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Prep & Season | — | — | 30–60 min rest before smoke |
| Smoke (unwrapped) | 6–8 hrs | 165 °F | Develop bark |
| Wrap | — | — | Add broth/tallow |
| Continue smoking | 3–5 hrs | 190–203 °F | Probe tender |
| Rest/Hold | 4–6 hrs | 145–155 °F | Collagen melts |
| **Total** | **14–18 hrs** | — | Ideal for overnight cook |

---

**Tip:** The longer the brisket holds between 140–165 °F, the more collagen breaks down.  
For maximum tenderness, aim for **4–5 hours** in the warmer at 150 °F.

---

Enjoy your authentic, Texas-style smoked brisket — with crisp bark, deep smoke ring, and tender slices that melt in your mouth.
