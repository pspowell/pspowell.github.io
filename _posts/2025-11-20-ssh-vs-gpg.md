# 🔐 SSH Key vs. GPG Key  
Here is a clear, practical explanation of **what a GPG key is**, **what an SSH key is**, and **how they differ**.

---

## **1. What an SSH key is**
SSH keys are used for **authentication into systems**.

### ✔️ SSH keys allow you to:
- Log into servers without a password  
- Authenticate to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket  
- Authenticate inside DDEV containers via SSH agent  
- Secure SCP/SFTP transfers  

### 🔑 An SSH key pair includes:
- **Private key:** `id_ed25519`  
- **Public key:** `id_ed25519.pub`

SSH keys prove:  
**“I am allowed to connect.”**

---

## **2. What a GPG key is**
A GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) key is used for **signing, encrypting, and verifying content**, especially identity‑based operations.

### ✔️ GPG keys allow you to:
- Digitally **sign Git commits** (proves they came from you)  
- Digitally **sign emails**  
- **Encrypt or decrypt** files and messages  
- Sign software releases so users know they are authentic  

### 🔑 A GPG key pair includes:
- **Private key** (kept secret)  
- **Public key** (shared so others can verify your signatures)

GPG keys prove:  
**“This message or code truly came from me.”**

# 🆚 Key Differences (Comparison)

| Feature | SSH Key | GPG Key |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Purpose | Authenticate to servers & services | Sign or encrypt data, commits, messages |
| Used in | SSH login, GitHub auth, DDEV, Linux servers | Git commit signing, encrypted email, secure messaging |
| Identifies | Your *access* | Your *identity* |
| Private key stays | On your device | On your device |
| Public key used for | Authorizing access | Verifying signatures / encryption |
| Trust model | Who is allowed in? | Who do we trust as the identity? |

# 🧠 The Simplest Analogy

### **SSH key = the key to unlock a door.**  
It lets you in.

### **GPG key = your wax seal on a document.**  
It proves the document came from you and wasn’t altered.

---

# ⚙️ Which one do YOU need?

### For GitHub:
- **SSH key** → authenticate (clone, pull, push)  
- **GPG key** → optional; marks commits as “verified”  

Most people only need SSH keys unless they want verified commits.

---

# 📌 When both are used on GitHub

- SSH key = login/authentication  
- GPG key = signature proving commits are genuine  

They **do not** replace each other.
