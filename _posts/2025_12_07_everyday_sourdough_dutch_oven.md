## Overview {#overview}

This is a simple, repeatable **Dutch oven sourdough** you can bake any weeknight.  
It uses **100% natural leavening**, assumes an active starter, and is optimized for strong oven spring and a crisp crust.

- Yield: 1 large loaf (about 800–900 g baked weight)  
- Hydration: ~70%  
- Total time: 8–24 hours

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

### Baker’s percentages {#bakers-percentages}

- 100% bread flour (or 80% bread flour + 20% whole wheat)
- 70% water
- 20% active starter (100% hydration)
- 2% fine sea salt

### For one loaf {#for-one-loaf}

- 450 g bread flour  
- 50 g whole wheat flour (or more bread flour)  
- 350 g water (reserve 20–30 g)  
- 100 g active sourdough starter  
- 10 g fine sea salt

## Method Overview {#method-overview}

This method relies on **steam trapped by the Dutch oven lid** to maximize oven spring before the crust sets.

---

## Step-by-Step {#steps}

### Autolyse {#autolyse}

Mix flour with 320–330 g water. Rest 30–60 minutes.

### Mix {#mix}

Add starter, salt, and remaining water. Pinch and fold until cohesive.

### Bulk Fermentation {#bulk}

- 3–4 stretch-and-fold sets in first 90 minutes  
- Total bulk: until **50–75% rise**, domed and jiggly

### Pre-shape & Bench Rest {#bench-rest}

Pre-shape into a round. Rest 20–30 minutes.

### Final Shape {#final-shape}

Shape into boule or batard. Place seam-side up in banneton.

### Proof {#proof}

- Same-day: 45–90 min at room temp  
- Overnight: 8–16 hours refrigerated (recommended)

## Bake (Dutch Oven) {#bake}

1. Preheat oven and Dutch oven to **475°F / 245°C** for 45–60 minutes.  
2. Turn dough onto parchment, seam-side down, and score.

**Covered bake (steam phase):**  
- 20 minutes, lid on

**Uncovered bake:**  
- Reduce to **450°F / 232°C**  
- Bake 20–25 minutes until **205–210°F internal**

Cool at least 1 hour before slicing.

## Crust & Crumb Tips {#crumb-tips}

- Pale crust → bake uncovered longer  
- Dense crumb → bulk longer or warmer  
- Gummy interior → under-baked or sliced early

Happy baking! 🥖
