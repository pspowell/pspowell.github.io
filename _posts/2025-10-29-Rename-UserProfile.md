Renaming the default Windows user profile folder (e.g., `C:\Users\John` ‚Üí `C:\Users\JohnDoe`) requires care. This guide provides **step-by-step instructions** and a **PowerShell script** that automates the registry update and folder rename safely.

## üß≠ Overview

Windows ties each user account to a unique SID and folder path under `C:\Users`. Simply renaming that folder breaks logins and causes OneDrive and app failures.  
This guide explains how to:

1. Detect whether you‚Äôre logged into the profile being changed  
2. Create a temporary local admin helper account if needed  
3. Rename the profile folder safely  
4. Update the registry and fix permissions automatically

## ü™ü How to Use

### 1. Run as Administrator

Open **Windows Terminal (Admin)** or **PowerShell (Admin)**, then run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$HOME\Downloads\Rename-UserProfile.ps1"
```

### 2. Enter Names

When prompted:

- **Current name:** the existing folder under `C:\Users`
- **New name:** your desired folder name

### 3. If You‚Äôre in the Profile to Be Renamed

If the script detects you‚Äôre logged into that profile, it will offer to:

- Create a helper admin (e.g., `Admin-Rename-Helper`)
- Copy the script to `C:\Users\Public`
- Instruct you to log out and run it from that new admin account

### 4. Complete the Rename

Once run from another admin:

1. The script updates the registry (`ProfileImagePath`)
2. Renames the folder
3. Repairs file ownership and ACL permissions

You‚Äôll see messages confirming each step.

## üîÅ After the Rename

1. **Reboot** the PC.  
2. **Sign into your renamed account** and verify the folder path:
   ```powershell
   echo $env:USERPROFILE
   ```
   Should show: `C:\Users\NewName`

3. **Re-link OneDrive** (if used):  
   Open OneDrive ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí *Unlink this PC* ‚Üí Sign in again.

---

## üßØ Rollback (If Needed)

If anything seems off:

1. Log in to another admin account.  
2. Rename the folder back to its original name.  
3. In Registry Editor, restore the original path under:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\<UserSID>
  ProfileImagePath = C:\Users\OldName
```

---

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Always **create a restore point** before renaming.  
- Ensure the target account is **signed out**.  
- **Do not** rename profiles for system or service accounts.  
- This method works for both **local** and **Microsoft** accounts.
