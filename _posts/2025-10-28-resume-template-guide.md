A senior recruiter once told me about the **only three things he really looks for in any CV**.

I was talking to a recruiter named **Mark**, who’s been in the market for about 15 years, hiring across finance, engineering, healthcare, and senior executive roles. I asked him, *“What are the top 3 things in a CV that get it through and earn a callback?”*

His answer was simple:  
> **Simple. Relevant. Scannable.**

At first, that surprised me — but he assured me that’s exactly how most recruiters think. They’re trying to understand your story quickly: **what you achieved, how you did it, and what the final result was.** Your CV has seconds to make that clear.

### 🧩 The Three Rules

#### 1. SIMPLE
Your CV must look **clean and professional**.  
Forget flashy graphics, colors, or overly creative fonts. Stick to a logical, uncluttered layout. The more boring it looks, the easier it is to read — and that’s a *good* thing.

#### 2. RELEVANT
Every bullet point should earn its place.  
Highlight only the experiences and results that relate to the position you’re applying for. Cut out unrelated early jobs or filler content. Recruiters want to know you’re a fit — nothing more, nothing less.

#### 3. SCANNABLE
This is the most important one.  
Recruiters skim dozens of resumes at high speed. Use **consistent headings, bullet points, and clear formatting** so they can grasp your value in 15 seconds or less.

### 🧾 Download the Resume Template

To make this easy, I’ve created a **professional resume template** built around these three principles.  
It uses **Times New Roman 12 pt**, simple formatting, and built-in guidance prompts.

### ✍️ How to Use It

1. Replace all italicized guidance text with your own information.  
2. Keep bullet points short and result-oriented (Achievement → Method → Result).  
3. Limit your CV to **one page** if possible, **two max** for senior roles.  
4. Export as PDF before sending — recruiters often print or forward them.

**Remember:** The most effective resumes aren’t flashy.  
They’re just very clear. In a few seconds, you should know exactly **who this person is** and **what value they can add**.
