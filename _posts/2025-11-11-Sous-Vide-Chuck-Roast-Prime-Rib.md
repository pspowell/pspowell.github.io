## 🥩 Sous Vide “Prime Rib Style” Chuck Roast

### 🔧 Equipment
- Sous vide immersion circulator
- Large pot or sous vide container
- Vacuum sealer and bag (or zip-top freezer bag with water displacement)
- Cast iron pan or grill for searing

---

### 🧂 Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Chuck roast | 2–3 lbs | Boneless, well-marbled |
| Kosher salt | 2 tsp | Adjust to taste |
| Black pepper | 1 tsp | Freshly ground |
| Garlic powder | 1 tsp | Optional |
| Fresh thyme or rosemary | 2 sprigs | Optional, for aromatics |
| Butter | 2 tbsp | For finishing |
| Olive oil | 1 tbsp | For searing |

### ⏱️ Temperature & Time

For **prime rib–like** tenderness and juiciness:

**135°F (57°C)** for **36–48 hours**

This long cook time converts collagen into gelatin slowly, giving chuck the tenderness of prime rib while keeping a rich, beefy flavor.

### 🍳 Directions

#### 1. Season and Bag
1. Pat the roast dry with paper towels.
2. Season liberally with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
3. Add herbs if desired.
4. Vacuum-seal the roast (or use a heavy-duty freezer bag and the water displacement method).

#### 2. Sous Vide
1. Preheat your water bath to **135°F (57°C)**.
2. Submerge the bag completely (clip it to the side if needed).
3. Cook for **36 to 48 hours**.
   - 36 hours: more structure, still very tender.
   - 48 hours: melt-in-your-mouth texture.

#### 3. Chill (Optional)
For best searing, remove the roast and chill in an ice bath for **15–20 minutes** to firm up the exterior.

#### 4. Sear
1. Pat the roast completely dry.
2. Heat oil in a cast iron pan over **high heat** until shimmering.
3. Sear each side for **45–60 seconds**, basting with butter and herbs during the final moments.
4. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.

### 🌿 Variations
- **Garlic-herb crust:** Rub roast with minced garlic, rosemary, and olive oil before bagging.
- **Au jus:** After cooking, save the bag juices, strain, and simmer briefly with a splash of red wine and beef stock.

### 🧠 Pro Tip
If you prefer a **slightly more traditional “prime rib” mouthfeel**, cook at **133°F (56°C)** for 48 hours—slightly more buttery, less chewy, but still sliceable.
