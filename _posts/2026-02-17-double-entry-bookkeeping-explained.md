Double-entry bookkeeping is a system where **every transaction is recorded in at least two accounts**—one side is a **debit** and the other side is a **credit**—so that the books always stay in balance.

## The core idea: the accounting equation {#accounting-equation}

At all times:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

Double-entry works because each transaction changes the equation in a balanced way.

## Debits and credits: what they really mean {#debits-and-credits}

A **debit** and a **credit** are just the two sides of an entry. They are not “good” or “bad,” and “debit” does not always mean “decrease.”

Instead, think of debits/credits as a **direction** that depends on the account type:

| Account type | Debit does… | Credit does… |
|---|---|---|
| **Assets** | increases | decreases |
| **Liabilities** | decreases | increases |
| **Equity** | decreases | increases |
| **Income (Revenue)** | decreases | increases |
| **Expenses** | increases | decreases |

A quick memory aid: **DEALER**  
- **D**ebits increase: **E**xpenses, **A**ssets  
- **L**iabilities, **E**quity, **R**evenue increase with credits

## What a transaction looks like {#what-a-transaction-looks-like}

Every transaction must balance:

**Total debits = Total credits**

That can be two lines, or many lines (a “split” transaction). The key rule is that the debits and credits add up to the same total.

## Common examples {#common-examples}

### 1) You buy a $30 item with cash {#example-cash-purchase}

- **Debit**: Expenses (or an Asset, if it’s equipment) +30  
- **Credit**: Cash (Asset) −30

Why it balances: one asset decreases (cash), an expense increases.

### 2) You buy $30 of supplies on a credit card {#example-credit-card-purchase}

- **Debit**: Supplies Expense +30  
- **Credit**: Credit Card Payable (Liability) +30

Key point: for a **liability**, a **credit increases** what you owe.

### 3) You pay your credit card bill ($100) from checking {#example-credit-card-payment}

- **Debit**: Credit Card Payable (Liability) −100  
- **Credit**: Checking (Asset) −100

You’re reducing what you owe (liability goes down with a debit) and reducing your cash.

### 4) A customer pays you $500 for services {#example-income}

- **Debit**: Checking (Asset) +500  
- **Credit**: Service Income (Revenue) +500

Revenue increases with credits.

## How this maps to “normal language” {#mapping-to-normal-language}

A helpful way to interpret most entries:

- If something you **own** increases → usually **debit an asset**
- If something you **owe** increases → usually **credit a liability**
- If you **earned** money → usually **credit income**
- If you **spent** money → usually **debit an expense**

But always validate using the table above and the rule “debits must equal credits.”

## What “balance” means {#what-balance-means}

“Balanced” does **not** mean your bank account matches the statement. It means:

- Every transaction’s debits equal its credits, and
- The overall accounting equation remains true.

Bank reconciliation is a separate process: matching your recorded cash transactions to what the bank reports.

## Typical beginner mistakes {#beginner-mistakes}

- Treating “debit” as “decrease” (it depends on the account type).
- Mixing up **expense** vs **asset** (e.g., tools/equipment may be assets).
- Recording only one side (single-entry thinking).
- Posting to the wrong account type (e.g., putting a credit-card purchase as a negative expense instead of increasing the liability).

## A quick self-check workflow {#self-check-workflow}

1. Identify the accounts involved (cash, credit card, income, expense, etc.).
2. Identify each account’s type (asset/liability/equity/income/expense).
3. Decide which accounts increase vs decrease.
4. Apply the debit/credit table.
5. Confirm: **sum(debits) = sum(credits)**.

If you tell me what kind of transaction you’re trying to record (cash, card, loan, owner draw, sales tax, etc.), I can translate it into the exact debit/credit lines you’d enter in your accounting software.
