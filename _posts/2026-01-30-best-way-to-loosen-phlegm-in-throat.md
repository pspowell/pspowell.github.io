Phlegm that feels “stuck” in your throat is usually **thick mucus** from a cold, allergies/post‑nasal drip, dry air, or reflux. The goal is to **thin it, moisten your airway, and move it upward** so you can clear it without tearing up your throat.

> **Note:** This is general information, not medical advice. If you have severe symptoms or high-risk conditions, contact a clinician.

## What works best (quick wins) {#quick-wins}

### 1) Warm fluids + steady sipping {#warm-fluids}
Thick mucus is harder to move. **Warm liquids help thin secretions** and soothe irritation.

- Warm water, tea, broth
- Sip continuously for 10–20 minutes
- Aim for pale-yellow urine over the day (a practical hydration check)

### 2) Steam / humid air {#steam}
Moist air can loosen sticky throat mucus fast.

- Hot shower (breathe in slowly)
- Bowl of hot water + towel (use caution to avoid burns)
- Humidifier in your room, especially overnight

**Tip:** Gentle nasal breaths + slow mouth exhales often feel better than big, forceful breaths.

### 3) Warm salt-water gargle {#salt-gargle}
A classic that targets the throat directly.

**Mix:** ½ teaspoon salt in 1 cup warm water  
**How:** Gargle deep in the throat for 20–30 seconds, repeat 2–3 times.

### 4) “Huff cough” (more effective than a normal cough) {#huff-cough}
If regular coughing isn’t moving anything, try this technique to push mucus upward.

1. Take a medium breath (not a huge one)
2. Forcefully exhale like fogging a mirror — **“huff”**
3. Do 2–3 huffs, then cough once to clear

### 5) Honey (optional lemon) {#honey}
Honey can coat and calm the throat while you work the mucus loose.

- 1 teaspoon honey straight, or in warm water/tea
- Add lemon if you like

> **Do not give honey to children under 1 year old.**

## Helpful add-ons {#add-ons}

### OTC expectorant: guaifenesin {#guaifenesin}
Guaifenesin (commonly sold as “Mucinex”) can help **loosen mucus**, but it works best when you also **drink plenty of water**.

- Follow the package directions
- Avoid combination products that heavily suppress cough unless you truly need cough suppression (you generally *want* mucus moving)

> If you have medical conditions or take multiple medications, check with a pharmacist.

### Nasal rinse for post-nasal drip {#nasal-rinse}
If the “throat phlegm” is actually drip from your nose/sinuses, a saline rinse can help.

- Use sterile/distilled water or properly boiled-and-cooled water
- Follow device instructions (neti pot / squeeze bottle)

## Things that can make it worse {#avoid}
These often thicken mucus or irritate the airway:

- Dehydration
- Very cold drinks (for some people)
- Alcohol
- Smoking/vaping
- Dry indoor air

Dairy is a mixed bag — it doesn’t create more mucus for most people, but it can make some folks feel “thicker.” If you notice that effect, pause it temporarily.

## When to get checked {#when-to-get-checked}
Seek medical care urgently if you have:

- Trouble breathing, wheezing, or lips/face turning blue/gray
- Chest pain, confusion, or severe weakness
- Coughing up blood (more than a tiny streak)

Contact a clinician soon (same day/next day) if you have:

- Fever that persists >3 days or returns after improving
- Phlegm that is foul-smelling, rust-colored, or persistently green with worsening symptoms
- Symptoms lasting longer than ~2 weeks
- Frequent “stuck mucus” along with **heartburn/reflux** or constant throat clearing (could be reflux-related)

## A simple 10-minute “unstick it” routine {#routine}
Try this in order:

1. **Warm drink** (2–3 minutes of sipping)
2. **Steam** (3–5 minutes)
3. **Salt-water gargle** (1 minute)
4. **Huff cough** (30 seconds)
5. Repeat once if needed

If you want to narrow the cause, ask yourself:  
- Is it worse **in the morning** (often post-nasal drip or reflux)?  
- Worse at **night** (often reflux or dry air)?  
- Any allergies, recent cold, or dry indoor heat?
