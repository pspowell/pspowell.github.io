## The Goal {#the-goal}

Make **sliceable, crisp-able gyro meat** with that tight, shop-style texture—using a **rolling pin + parchment paper** method that compresses the meat like a rotisserie cone (without special gear).

---

## Why the Parchment Roll Works {#why-the-parchment-roll-works}

Rolling the seasoned meat into a tight parchment “log” does three important things:

- **Compression:** removes air pockets so it doesn’t crumble like meatloaf.
- **Binding:** encourages protein extraction (myosin) so it slices cleanly.
- **Even cooking:** a uniform thickness cooks predictably.

---

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

### Meat {#ingredients-meat}

- 1 lb ground lamb *(or 50/50 lamb + beef)*
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon *(subtle, but authentic)*
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg *(optional)*

### Aromatics {#ingredients-aromatics}

- 1 small onion, **grated**
- 2–3 cloves garlic, minced or pasted

> **Important:** After grating the onion, squeeze it hard in a towel/paper towels. Too much onion water = soft, steamy texture.

---

## The “Food Processor” Step (and Easy Alternatives) {#food-processor-alternatives}

A food processor is popular because it quickly turns the mixture into a **sticky, smooth paste**—that stickiness is the texture secret.

No processor? Use one of these:

### Stand Mixer (Best Substitute) {#stand-mixer}

- Use the **paddle** attachment.
- Mix on **medium** for **3–5 minutes**.
- Stop when the meat looks **glossy and tacky** and pulls in slightly stringy strands.

### Hand Mixing + “Slap” Method (Very Good) {#hand-slap}

- Mix until combined, then repeatedly **lift and slam** the meat back into the bowl.
- Do **50–100 slaps** until it becomes **tacky** and cohesive.

### Knife-Chop Method (Good If You Work It) {#knife-chop}

- After onion is squeezed dry, pile everything on a board.
- **Chop and smear** with a chef’s knife for **2–3 minutes**, then knead in a bowl until sticky.

### Extra Binding Helpers (Optional) {#binding-helpers}

If you’re hand-mixing and want a little extra insurance:

- 1–2 Tbsp **olive oil** (helps emulsify)
- 1 Tbsp **ice-cold water** added gradually while mixing

## Rolling Pin + Parchment Method {#rolling-pin-parchment}

### 1) Roll It Flat {#roll-it-flat}

1. Lay down an ~18" sheet of parchment.
2. Put meat in the center.
3. Cover with a second parchment sheet.
4. Use a rolling pin to flatten into a rectangle about:
   - **3/4" thick**
   - roughly **8" × 10"**

### 2) Roll It Tight {#roll-it-tight}

1. Peel off the top parchment.
2. Use the bottom parchment to roll it up **like a jelly roll**.
3. Twist the ends hard, like a candy wrapper, to compress the log.

### 3) Chill {#chill}

Chill **at least 1 hour** (overnight is best).  
Cold meat = firmer structure = cleaner slicing.

---

## Bake {#bake}

- Oven: **350°F (175°C)**
- Place the wrapped log on a rimmed sheet pan.
- Bake **35–40 minutes** until the center reaches **160°F**.

**Optional compression:** Set a second sheet pan on top of the log while baking (or for the last half of the bake) to increase density.

---

## Cooling & Slicing: “Against the Grain” Explained {#cooling-slicing}

You’re right: gyro doesn’t have a natural “grain” like steak.

In gyro, the “grain” people refer to is **created by rolling and compression**—proteins align mostly **along the length of the log**. So the correct instruction is:

> **Slice thin across the log (perpendicular to its length).**

### How to slice {#how-to-slice}

1. Rest the cooked log 15 minutes.
2. For ultra-thin slices, chill it **20–30 minutes** first.
3. Slice **crosswise** into **1/16"–1/8"** pieces.

## Crisping Like a Shop {#crisping}

To get those browned gyro edges:

- Heat a skillet very hot.
- Add slices **dry** (no oil), or just a tiny smear of oil.
- Cook 45–90 seconds per side until edges brown and slightly curl.

---

## Serving {#serving}

- Warm pita
- Tomato + onion
- Tzatziki (yogurt + cucumber + garlic + dill + lemon + olive oil)
- Optional: fries inside the sandwich (Greek-style)

---

## Quick Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

- **Crumbly slices:** not mixed enough / not compressed enough / not chilled long enough.
- **Rubbery “hot-dog” bite:** slices too thick, or you sliced lengthwise instead of crosswise.
- **Soft/steamy texture:** onion not squeezed dry, or log not compressed.
