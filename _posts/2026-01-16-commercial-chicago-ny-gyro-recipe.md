## Overview {#overview}

This recipe reflects the **commercial gyro cone profile** used by Chicago and NYC gyro shops.  
It is **not home-style Greek lamb** and intentionally avoids spices common in traditional Greek roasts.

The defining characteristics are:
- Beef-forward flavor
- Dense, sliceable texture
- Subtle oregano and coriander
- No visible herbs
- Sausage-like emulsification

---

## Meat Ratio {#meat-ratio}

- **55–60% beef** (80/20)
- **40–45% lamb**

This ratio matches Midwestern and Northeast commercial suppliers.

---

## Onion & Garlic Processing (Critical) {#onion-processing}

### Purpose
Fresh onion and garlic are used for **enzymes and sugars**, not flavor or texture.

### Method
1. Purée together:
   - 1 medium onion (110–130 g raw)
   - 2–3 garlic cloves
2. Strain through cheesecloth or fine mesh
3. **Squeeze hard** until only a damp paste remains
4. Discard free liquid
5. Use **only the squeezed solids**

This removes water and harsh sulfur bite while preserving protein-binding chemistry.

## Commercial Spice Profile (Per 1 kg / 2.2 lb Meat) {#spice-profile}

| Spice | Grams | % of Meat |
|---|---:|---:|
| Kosher salt | 18.0 g | 1.80% |
| Dried oregano (very fine) | 4.0 g | 0.40% |
| Ground coriander | 3.0 g | 0.30% |
| Ground cumin | 2.5 g | 0.25% |
| Sweet paprika | 2.0 g | 0.20% |
| Black pepper (fine) | 1.5 g | 0.15% |
| Garlic powder | 1.5 g | 0.15% |
| Onion powder | 1.5 g | 0.15% |
| Ground rosemary (powdered) | 0.6 g | 0.06% |
| Ground nutmeg | 0.4 g | 0.04% |

**Total spice load:** ~36 g per kg meat

## Mixing & Emulsification {#emulsification}

1. Combine:
   - Ground meats
   - Squeezed onion/garlic paste
   - All spices
2. Mix aggressively by hand or paddle mixer for **3–5 minutes**
3. Target texture:
   - Sticky
   - Elastic
   - Smooth paste (not crumbly)

This emulsification step is more important than exact spice ratios.

## Cooking (Commercial-Style Loaf) {#cooking}

1. Pack tightly into a loaf pan
2. Place loaf pan in a water bath
3. Bake at **325°F (165°C)** until internal temp reaches **165°F**
4. Drain fat
5. Press firmly while hot
6. Chill **at least 2 hours**, preferably overnight

---

## Slicing & Service {#slicing}

- Slice **very thin**, against the grain
- Crisp slices on a hot flat-top or cast iron skillet
- Serve in pita with tzatziki, tomato, onion

Optional but common: fries inside the wrap.

---

## What This Recipe Intentionally Excludes {#exclusions}

- Cinnamon  
- Allspice  
- Clove  
- Thyme  
- Lemon zest  
- Fresh herbs  

Those belong to home-style Greek lamb, not gyro cones.

---

## Flavor Profile {#flavor-profile}

- Initial bite: savory beef
- Mid-palate: oregano + coriander
- Finish: cumin warmth and nutmeg depth
- Aftertaste: roasted meat and fat, not herbs

If oregano dominates, the meat was under-emulsified or herbs were too coarse.

---

## Notes on Authenticity {#authenticity}

This profile is derived from:
- Commercial ingredient labels
- USDA FSIS filings
- Bulk seasoning supplier specs
- Shop processing SOPs

Exact formulations are proprietary, but this falls squarely within verified commercial ranges.
