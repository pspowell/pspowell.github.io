## Overview {#overview}
A rich, Cajun-style gumbo with a deep, dark roux, tender chicken, and smoky andouille—made faster in the Instant Pot.

> **Cajun vs. Creole:** Skip tomatoes for a more traditional Cajun gumbo. Add tomatoes (and usually okra) for a more Creole/New Orleans-leaning version.

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

### Roux {#roux}
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

### Gumbo {#gumbo-ingredients}
- 12 oz andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs (or breasts), cubed
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced *(the “holy trinity”)*
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1–2 tsp Cajun seasoning (to taste)
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp cayenne *(optional)*
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes *(optional)*
- 1 cup sliced okra *(fresh or frozen; optional but traditional in many styles)*
- Salt & black pepper, to taste
- 2–3 green onions, sliced
- Fresh parsley, chopped

### For serving {#for-serving}
- Cooked white rice
- File powder *(optional; add at the table—don’t boil it)*

## Steps {#steps}

### 1) Make the roux (flavor step) {#make-the-roux}
1. Set the Instant Pot to **Sauté (High)**.
2. Add oil and flour. Whisk or stir constantly until the roux turns **dark peanut-butter to chocolate** in color (about **10–15 minutes**).
3. If it smells burnt or you see black specks, discard and restart—burnt roux will make the whole pot bitter.

### 2) Cook the trinity and spices {#cook-the-trinity}
1. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery. Cook **3–4 minutes** until softened.
2. Stir in garlic, thyme, Cajun seasoning, paprika, cayenne, and bay leaf for **30–60 seconds**.

### 3) Add meat and deglaze {#add-meat-deglaze}
1. Add sausage and chicken; stir to coat in the roux.
2. Pour in broth (and tomatoes if using).
3. **Scrape the bottom thoroughly** to remove any stuck bits (helps avoid the burn warning).

### 4) Pressure cook {#pressure-cook}
1. Lock the lid.
2. Cook on **High Pressure for 10 minutes**.
3. Let it **natural release for 10 minutes**, then carefully quick release.

### 5) Thicken and finish {#thicken-finish}
1. Switch back to **Sauté (Low)**.
2. Add okra and simmer **5–10 minutes** until thickened to your liking.
3. Remove bay leaf. Taste and adjust salt/pepper.
4. Stir in green onions and parsley.

## Serve {#serve}
Spoon gumbo over hot rice. Add a pinch of file powder at the table if you like.

## Notes & options {#notes-options}
- **No tomatoes:** more Cajun-leaning.
- **With tomatoes + okra:** more Creole-leaning.
- **Heat control:** start light on Cajun seasoning, then adjust after cooking (sausage and seasoning blends vary).
- **Seafood variation:** pressure cook base without seafood; add shrimp during the final sauté and cook just until pink.
