## üß† Understanding the Covered Call

When you sell (write) a **covered call**, you:

1. **Own** 100 shares of the stock (the ‚Äúcovered‚Äù part).
2. **Sell** someone else the *right*‚Äîbut not the obligation‚Äîto buy your shares at a specific **strike price** before **expiration**.

Until that option expires or is exercised, you are *obligated* to sell your shares at the strike price **if** the buyer exercises.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens If the Market Crashes

If the stock price plunges **below** your strike price:

- The call option will **lose value** and likely expire worthless.  
- You keep your shares and the **premium** you received.  
- However, your **shares lose value** with the market, just like any other shareholder.

You are **not locked in** from selling your stock ‚Äî but you must handle it carefully.

## üßæ Your Choices During a Crash

### **1. Close Both Legs Manually**

You can **unwind** the position before expiration:

1. **Buy back the call option** (close the short call).
2. **Sell your stock**.

This frees you completely ‚Äî you‚Äôve exited both the stock and the obligation.

- You‚Äôll pay the **current market price** to buy back the call (usually cheap after a crash).  
- Then you can sell your stock immediately at market.

‚úÖ *This is the cleanest way to sell your stock while a call is open.*

---

### **2. Wait for Expiration**

If the stock stays well below the strike:

- The call expires worthless.  
- You can then sell your shares anytime afterward.  
- You keep 100% of the premium as income.

‚úÖ *This works if you‚Äôre not in a hurry to sell and think the stock may rebound.*

---

### **3. Roll the Option Down or Out**

If you want to manage losses or adjust your position:

- **Buy back** the existing call.
- **Sell a new one** with a lower strike or a later expiration date.

This generates more income but keeps you invested.

‚úÖ *Useful for gradual exit or ‚Äúincome averaging,‚Äù not emergency liquidation.*

## üö® Important Warning

Never sell the stock **without first closing the call** ‚Äî doing so would leave you **naked short a call**, which is **very risky**.

If the stock rebounds sharply, you could be forced to buy back shares at much higher prices to cover your short call.
