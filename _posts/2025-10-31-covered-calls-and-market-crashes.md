## üß† Understanding the Covered Call

When you sell (write) a **covered call**, you:

1. **Own** 100 shares of the stock (the ‚Äúcovered‚Äù part).
2. **Sell** someone else the *right*‚Äîbut not the obligation‚Äîto buy your shares at a specific **strike price** before **expiration**.

Until that option expires or is exercised, you are *obligated* to sell your shares at the strike price **if** the buyer exercises.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens If the Market Crashes

If the stock price plunges **below** your strike price:

- The call option will **lose value** and likely expire worthless.  
- You keep your shares and the **premium** you received.  
- However, your **shares lose value** with the market, just like any other shareholder.

You are **not locked in** from selling your stock ‚Äî but you must handle it carefully.

## üßæ Your Choices During a Crash

### **1. Close Both Legs Manually**

You can **unwind** the position before expiration:

1. **Buy back the call option** (close the short call).
2. **Sell your stock**.
