## The Core Rules {#core-rules}

- **Don’t explain.** Explanations become ammunition.
- **Don’t defend.** Defense implies their accusation matters.
- **Don’t emote.** Emotion feeds the behavior.
- **Don’t correct their narrative.** They are not seeking truth.

## The Only Tone That Works {#only-tone}

- Calm  
- Brief  
- Boring  
- Unreactive

Think *HR email*, not conversation.

## What to Say (Templates) {#templates}

- “That doesn’t work for me.”  
- “I’ve made my decision.”  
- “We’ll stick to the agreed process.”  
- “I’m not discussing that.”  
- “Please put that in writing.”  
- “This conversation is no longer productive.”

Then stop talking.

## What They Want vs. What You Give {#wants-vs-give}

| They Want | You Give |
|-----------|----------|
| Control | Boundaries |
| Reaction | Neutrality |
| Engagement | Closure |
| Power | Predictability |

## The Mental Reframe (Critical) {#mental-reframe}

- You are **managing behavior**, not **resolving conflict**.
- Winning is **ending the exchange**, not changing them.
- Silence after a boundary is **not weakness—it’s enforcement**.

## The Exit Rule {#exit-rule}

Once you’ve stated a boundary **once**:

- Repeating it = negotiation  
- Arguing it = validation  
- Explaining it = surrender

**State → Pause → Disengage.**
