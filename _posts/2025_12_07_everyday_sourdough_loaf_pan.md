- Yield: 1 pan loaf (750–850 g baked)  
- Hydration target: ~65–68%  
- Total time: 8–24 hours

---

## Base Dough Formula {#base-dough}

This loaf uses the same base dough as the Dutch oven method, with slightly lower hydration.

- 450 g bread flour (optionally 50 g whole wheat)
- 300–320 g water
- 100 g active starter
- 10 g fine sea salt

## Shaping for a Loaf Pan {#shaping}

1. Pre-shape into a loose rectangle.
2. Fold top third down, bottom third up.
3. Roll tightly into a log, sealing the seam.
4. Place **seam-side down** in a greased or parchment-lined 8.5 × 4.5 in pan.

---

## Proofing {#proofing}

Proof until dough rises **~1 inch above rim** and springs back slowly when poked.

- Room temp: 2–4 hours
- Cold proof: 8–14 hours (recommended)

---

## Baking {#baking}

1. Preheat oven to **425°F / 218°C**.
2. Add a steam tray to the lower rack.
3. Bake **uncovered** for **20 minutes**.
4. Reduce to **375°F** and bake another **20–25 minutes** until **205–210°F internal**.

Remove from pan immediately and cool fully.

## Steam, Foil, and Crust Control {#steam-and-foil}

- **Steam:** Keeps crust flexible early for oven spring.
- **Foil:** Never at the start. Loosely tent only after 15–25 minutes if browning too fast.

---

## Texture & Crumb Tips {#crumb}

- Dense crumb → bulk longer
- Sunken top → over-proofed
- Gummy crumb → under-baked or sliced early

---

## Variations {#variations}

- Soft sandwich loaf: add 5–8% oil or butter
- Milk loaf: replace 25–50% water with milk
- Seeded loaf: roll shaped dough in seeds
- Pullman loaf: lidded pan, no steam

Happy baking! 🍞
