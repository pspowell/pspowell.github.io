## Quick HD replacement with SSD on a laptop for under $30

This is just a quick recounting of how I'd replace the Hard Disk on a laptop PC, for under $30. Prices change daily, so you'll find different deals, but the cost will be similar.

1. Bought a [USB 3.0 Drive enclosure](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M08LCXW?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to temporarily hold the SSD, and the replace HD as backup later on.
2. Bought a [240 GB SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WMP88Z3?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
3. Imaged the Hard Disk onto the SSD using [Hiren's BootCD PE](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/hirens-clone-disk.html#:~:text=Use%20Hirens%20to%20Clone%20Disk%201%201.%20Open,%22%2C%20and%20then%20follow%20the%20steps%20to%20continue.)
4. Removed the Hard Disk and installed the SSD
5. Put the Hard Disk in the drive enclosure for a backup drive

Fin!
