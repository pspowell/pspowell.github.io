Shredded paper (from a home/office paper shredder) is one of the best **carbon-rich bedding materials** you can add to a worm farm—*as long as you prepare and use it correctly*. This guide covers what to use, what to avoid, and how to keep your bin healthy and odor-free.

## Why shredded paper works {#why-shredded-paper-works}

Composting worms (commonly “red wigglers”) thrive in bedding that is:

- **Carbon-rich** (balances nitrogen-heavy food scraps)
- **Moist but airy** (holds water while allowing oxygen flow)
- **Microbe-friendly** (worms primarily consume microbes living on the bedding/food)

Shredded paper excels at moisture retention and creates a fluffy structure—when it’s kept **damp and loose**.

## What paper shredder waste is safe {#what-paper-is-safe}

### Safe and recommended {#safe-and-recommended}

- Plain office paper
- Non-glossy junk mail
- Newspaper
- Paper bags (brown kraft)
- Cardboard (shredded or torn into strips)

### Use sparingly {#use-sparingly}

- Lightly colored paper
- Window envelopes (**remove the plastic window**)

### Avoid {#avoid}

- Glossy magazine pages or heavily coated paper
- Thermal receipt paper
- Paper with strong chemical odor or “waxy” coating
- Heavily dyed construction paper (often dye-heavy)

## The most important step: pre-moisten the shreds {#pre-moisten}

The #1 mistake is adding shredded paper **dry** (it wicks moisture away from worms) or adding it **packed** (it mats and turns anaerobic).

### Proper prep {#proper-prep}

1. **Shred** the paper (cross-cut shreds are ideal, but strip shreds also work).
2. Put shreds in a bucket or tub.
3. Add water and let soak **10–30 minutes**.
4. **Squeeze** handfuls until it’s like a *wrung-out sponge*:
   - Damp and cool
   - No dripping when squeezed
   - Fluffy and springy, not clumped

If it drips a lot → too wet (add dry bedding, fluff, increase airflow).  
If it feels dusty/crispy → too dry (mist or re-soak).

## How much to add (bedding vs. food) {#how-much-to-add}

Shredded paper is primarily **bedding**, not worm “food” by itself.

A practical rule of thumb:

- **2–3 parts bedding : 1 part food scraps (by volume)**

Each time you add kitchen scraps:

- **Bury** the scraps under the bedding.
- **Cover** with a layer of damp shredded paper.

This simple routine dramatically reduces:

- Fruit flies
- Odors
- Overheating from “hot” food piles

## Best results: blend paper with other bedding {#blend-with-other-bedding}

Paper alone can work, but mixing improves airflow and stability.

Good bedding partners:

- Shredded cardboard (adds structure)
- Coco coir (moisture buffering)
- Aged leaves (microbial variety)
- A handful of finished compost (microbe inoculation)
- Crushed eggshells (helps buffer acidity)

## Common mistakes and fixes {#mistakes-and-fixes}

### Dry bedding additions {#dry-bedding}

**Problem:** Worms flee or hang at the edges; bin looks dusty.  
**Fix:** Pre-soak paper; lightly mist; mix bedding through the top few inches.

### Compaction and “paper mats” {#compaction}

**Problem:** Sour smell, slimy zones, paper forms sheets.  
**Fix:** Fluff and mix; add coarse bedding (cardboard strips); avoid packing.

### Too much food / not enough bedding {#too-much-food}

**Problem:** Ammonia or rotting smell, gnats/flies, overheating.  
**Fix:** Reduce feeding; add lots of damp bedding; bury food deeper.

### Too much bedding / not enough nitrogen {#too-much-bedding}

**Problem:** Bin looks “clean” but progress is slow.  
**Fix:** Add modest food scraps; consider adding a small amount of aged compost to seed microbes.

## How to tell it’s working {#signs-its-working}

Healthy bins with shredded paper typically show:

- Paper slowly disappearing over weeks
- Earthy smell (not sour or ammonia)
- Worms distributed through the bedding
- Moist, crumbly texture (not sludge)

If worms are trying to escape or clustering at the sides/top, check:

- Moisture (too wet or too dry)
- Temperature (too hot)
- Acidity (add crushed eggshells, reduce citrus/onion, add bedding)

## Simple routine you can follow {#simple-routine}

1. Keep a **3–6 inch** bedding layer.
2. Feed scraps in small pockets (rotate locations).
3. Always **cover** scraps with damp shredded paper.
4. Fluff the top layer occasionally to prevent matting.
5. Add bedding whenever the bin starts to look dense or wet.

## Quick checklist {#quick-checklist}

- [ ] Use mostly non-glossy paper/cardboard
- [ ] Always **pre-soak and wring out**
- [ ] Keep bedding fluffy (avoid mats)
- [ ] Maintain a bedding-to-food balance (about **2–3:1**)
- [ ] Cover food to control flies and odor
