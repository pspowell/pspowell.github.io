## Overview {#overview}

This is a **true 100% rye sourdough**, built using traditional **sour + scald stages** for structure, sweetness, and shelf life. There is **no wheat flour and no kneading**. Texture is dense but sliceable, moist, and deeply aromatic.

This method reflects classic German and Eastern European rye techniques adapted for a home oven.

## Why Rye Needs a Scald {#why-rye-needs-a-scald}

Rye flour behaves very differently from wheat. It contains:

- High enzymatic activity (amylase)
- Little usable gluten
- A strong tendency toward gumminess if unmanaged

A **hot scald** gelatinizes starches, controls enzymes, and unlocks natural sweetness—essential for a stable crumb.

---

## Formula Summary {#formula-summary}

- **100% dark rye flour**
- **85–90% total hydration**
- **3 stages:** sour → scald → final paste
- **Pan baked** only

---

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

### Rye Sour (12–16 hours)

- 40 g ripe rye sourdough starter
- 160 g dark rye flour
- 160 g water (room temperature)

### Rye Scald (same day)

- 120 g dark rye flour
- 240 g boiling water
- 1 tbsp molasses or barley malt syrup (optional but traditional)

### Final Dough

- All of the rye sour
- All of the rye scald
- 120 g dark rye flour
- 8–10 g salt
- 1 tsp caraway seeds (optional)

**Total flour:** 400 g rye

## Stage 1: Build the Rye Sour {#build-the-rye-sour}

Mix starter, rye flour, and water until smooth. Cover and ferment at room temperature for **12–16 hours**.

The sour should smell tangy, fruity, and mildly acidic—not sharp or alcoholic.

---

## Stage 2: Prepare the Rye Scald {#prepare-the-rye-scald}

1. Place rye flour in a heatproof bowl.
2. Pour boiling water over the flour.
3. Add molasses or malt syrup if using.
4. Stir vigorously until a thick porridge forms.

Cover tightly and rest **3–6 hours**. The scald will sweeten and thicken noticeably as it cools.

---

## Stage 3: Mix the Final Dough {#mix-the-final-dough}

1. Combine the rye sour and rye scald in a large bowl.
2. Add remaining rye flour, salt, and caraway.
3. Mix thoroughly with a spoon or wet hand.

The result is a **thick paste**, not a dough. It should hold shape briefly when smoothed.

## Pan, Proof, and Bake {#pan-proof-bake}

### Pan and Smooth {#pan-and-smooth}

- Grease or line a loaf pan thoroughly.
- Scrape the paste into the pan.
- Smooth the top with wet hands or a spatula.
- Optionally dust with rye flour.

---

### Final Proof {#final-proof}

- Cover and proof **1½–2½ hours** at room temperature.
- Look for fine surface cracks and a slight dome.

Avoid over-proofing—collapse is irreversible.

---

### Bake {#bake}

1. Preheat oven to **475°F (245°C)**.
2. Introduce steam for the first 10 minutes.
3. Bake **15 minutes at 475°F**.
4. Reduce to **375°F (190°C)** and bake **50–60 minutes**.

Target internal temperature: **205–210°F**.

Remove loaf from pan immediately after baking.

## Curing the Bread {#curing-the-bread}

This step is **not optional** for 100% rye.

- Cool completely (minimum 12 hours).
- Wrap tightly in parchment or linen.
- Rest **24–48 hours** before slicing.

During curing, starches set and flavor deepens dramatically.

---

## Storage and Shelf Life {#storage-and-shelf-life}

- Keeps **7–10 days** at room temperature.
- Flavor improves through day 3–4.
- Excellent thin-sliced and toasted.

---

## Common Problems and Fixes {#common-problems}

- **Gummy crumb:** under-baked or sliced too early
- **Collapsed loaf:** over-proofed
- **Dry crumb:** insufficient hydration or scald time

---

## Notes {#notes}

This bread rewards patience. Proper scalding, gentle fermentation, and long curing are the difference between a brick and a beautiful traditional rye loaf.
