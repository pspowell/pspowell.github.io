## Overview

Windows provides several ways to capture or back up a system—each built for a different purpose.  
Here’s how **DISM**, **SDCLT**, and **Disk2VHD** compare.

---

## 1. DISM (`/capture-image`) — Deployment or Forensic Imaging

**Purpose:** Create a **WIM (Windows Imaging Format)** file by capturing a partition at the *file level*.  

### Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Granularity** | File-based; copies files, ACLs, reparse points, and optional `/ea` metadata |
| **Output format** | `.wim` (compressed, mountable) |
| **Compression** | Fast, Max, or Recovery (`/compress:max`) |
| **Bootability** | Not bootable; restore with `dism /apply-image` and `bcdboot` |
| **Flexibility** | Can capture or restore any partition; editable via `dism /mount-wim` |
| **Restoration** | Requires manual apply and boot setup |

### When to Use
- Creating deployable Windows images  
- Capturing clean system states for redeployment  
- Forensic or archival captures needing compression  

### Limitations
- Manual restore steps  
- Doesn’t copy MBR/partition table  
- Must capture EFI/Recovery partitions separately

## 2. SDCLT (Windows Backup) — Legacy System Imaging

**Purpose:** Make a **block-level system image** for bare-metal restore.  
(`sdclt.exe /BLBBACKUPWIZARD` launches the GUI.)

### Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Granularity** | Sector-level clone |
| **Output format** | `.vhd` files in “WindowsImageBackup” folder |
| **Bootability** | Yes; restores via Windows Recovery |
| **Ease of use** | Point-and-click |
| **Status** | Deprecated since Windows 10 1803 |

### When to Use
- Full system restore on same hardware  
- Simple, non-technical recovery workflow  

### Limitations
- Deprecated and potentially removed in future builds  
- Large, minimally-compressed output  
- Less flexible for deployment or editing

## 3. Disk2VHD — Virtualization-Ready Clones

**Purpose:** Clone a live system into a bootable **VHD/VHDX** for Hyper-V or other virtualization.

### Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Granularity** | Sector-level (via Volume Shadow Copy) |
| **Output format** | `.vhd` or `.vhdx` |
| **Bootability** | Bootable as a virtual machine |
| **Compression** | None |
| **Use case** | Physical-to-Virtual (P2V) migration |

### When to Use
- Virtualizing your physical PC  
- Testing or sandboxing your current install  

### Limitations
- Large files, no compression  
- Not suited for compact backups

## Comparison Summary

| Feature | **DISM** | **SDCLT** | **Disk2VHD** |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Capture Type | File-level | Block-level | Block-level |
| Output | `.wim` | `.vhd` | `.vhd/.vhdx` |
| Compression | Yes | Minimal | None |
| Bootable | No | Yes | Yes (VM) |
| Restore Ease | Manual | Automatic | VM-only |
| Portability | High | Medium | Medium |
| Ideal Use | Deployment / Imaging | Disaster Recovery | Virtualization Clone |

---

## Choosing the Right Tool

| Goal | Recommended Tool |
|------|------------------|
| Compact, redeployable system image | **DISM /capture-image** |
| Full, restorable backup | **SDCLT** *(or modern alternative like Macrium Reflect)* |
| Virtual machine clone | **Disk2VHD** |
