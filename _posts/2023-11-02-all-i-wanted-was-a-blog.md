I Wanted to use Github Pages to host a static website, where I could just publish markdown documents and have a blog.

Well, to do that as a Windows user, I [needed to update Windows to WSL2](https://winaero.com/update-from-wsl-to-wsl-2-in-windows-10/#:~:text=Updating%20from%20WSL%20to%20WSL%202%20will%20require,version%205%20Install%20a%20Linux%20distro%20inside%20it.), then install Linux Ubuntu from the store and start it all up.  Only then could I [install Ruby, Jekyll](https://bartjolling.github.io/blog/2023/10/21/jekyll-on-wsl-ubuntu-22-04.html), and  [then here](https://bartjolling.github.io/blog/2018/11/18/jekyll-on-wsl-for-github-pages.html#setting-up-a-github-repository-to-host-your-github-pages) etc.
With the scaffolding installed, I had to create the repository, bring it down, and set it up, FINALLY getting the localhost running, only to run into problems authenticating with github ([update Git](https://7.dev/how-to-update-git-in-ubuntu-windows-subsystem-for-linux/) and set the credential manager) so I could push it back up. 
 
While I wouldn't recommend this particular journey to anyone not looking for punishment, it does highlight how difficult some tasks have become that shouldn't be. The purpose of this blog is to wade through this hard stuff and present a simpler version.  As a 50 year professional in tech, I hope to wade through all the unhelpful stuff to bring you to the path that works.  Wish me luck!
