## Using Boiled Linseed Oil and 4F Pumice Powder

This guide explains how to make and use a professional-quality wood grain filler using **boiled linseed oil** and **4F grade pumice powder**.  
The 4F grade (very fine, approximately 75–100 microns) is **strongly recommended** for filling small pores without leaving a gritty residue.  
It works exceptionally well on open-grained woods such as *oak, ash,* or *walnut* to create a mirror-smooth surface before applying varnish, shellac, or lacquer.

## Materials Needed

- Boiled Linseed Oil (BLO)  
- 4F Very Fine Grade Pumice Powder (any brand)  
- Clean cotton cloths or t-shirt rags  
- Rubber gloves and respirator (for dust safety)  
- Small bowl or dish for mixing  
- Soft brush or applicator pad  
- Optional: stain or pigment for tinting filler

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare the Surface:**  
   Sand your wood to 180–220 grit. Remove all dust using a tack cloth or vacuum.

2. **Apply Boiled Linseed Oil:**  
   Wipe on a thin layer of boiled linseed oil using a clean cloth.  
   The surface should look wet but not puddled.

3. **Add Pumice:**  
   While the oil remains wet, sprinkle a small amount of **4F pumice** (about one teaspoon per square foot) onto the surface.

4. **Work the Mixture In:**  
   Rub the mixture into the wood pores using a circular motion with a soft cloth.  
   As the pumice mixes with the oil and wood dust, it forms a slurry that fills the pores evenly.

5. **Optional — Tint the Mixture:**  
   For colored grain filling, mix an *oil-based stain* or *artist’s oil pigment* directly into the linseed oil before adding the pumice.  
   This creates a tinted filler that can darken the pore contrast or match the overall tone of your project.  
   Stir thoroughly before applying to ensure even color distribution.

6. **Wipe Off Excess:**  
   Once the pores are filled, wipe **across the grain** to remove surface residue.  
   Avoid leaving any layer of filler to dry on the surface.

7. **Dry and Cure:**  
   Let the surface dry for **48–72 hours**. The filled surface should feel smooth and firm to the touch before proceeding.

8. **Inspect and Repeat:**  
   Check the surface under low-angle (raking) light. Reapply the filler to any remaining open pores.

9. **Final Sanding and Finish:**  
   After full curing, lightly sand with **320 grit**, then apply your chosen finish such as shellac, varnish, or lacquer.

## Important Note on Stained Surfaces

Avoid applying this filler mixture **on already-stained wood**.  
The rubbing action required to fill the pores can lift or smear the color, creating uneven tone.  
If you intend to both stain and fill the wood, perform the **filling step first**, allow it to cure completely, and then apply stain over the filled surface.

## Tips and Notes

- **4F pumice** (~75–100 µm) is ideal for fine pore filling; coarser grades may leave visible scratches.  
- Use minimal oil — excess oil slows drying and may cause tackiness.  
- Always dispose of oil-soaked rags safely (store in water or an airtight metal container).  
- Work in a ventilated area.  
- Inspect under raking light to confirm all pores are completely filled before applying finish coats.

Always verify that the product is labeled as **4F (very fine)** grade.  
Avoid generic pumice intended for cleaning or horticultural use — these are too coarse for wood finishing.

## Final Advice

Before applying to your main project, always test the filler process on a **scrap piece** of the same wood species.  
Properly filled and sanded surfaces will produce a flawless, mirror-smooth foundation for your final finish.
