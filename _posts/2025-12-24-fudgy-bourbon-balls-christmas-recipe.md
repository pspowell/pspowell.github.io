## Ingredients {#ingredients}

- 2½ cups (280 g) chocolate cookie crumbs (such as chocolate graham crackers)
- 1¼ cups (125 g) pecans, whole/halved/pieces

## Instructions {#instructions}

1. **Grind.** In a food processor, pulse the cookie crumbs and pecans together until the nuts are finely ground.  
   *(The crumbs help prevent the nuts from turning into nut butter.)*
2. **Mix & rest.** In a bowl, stir together the bourbon, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and honey. Add this mixture to the food processor and pulse just until combined.  
   Let the dough rest **overnight**, uncovered, at room temperature to dry slightly.
3. **Roll & finish.** Roll the dough into balls about **1 inch** in diameter. Toss in powdered sugar to coat.  
   - Store **airtight** for moist centers  
   - Store **uncovered** for a crunchy sugar crust  
   Sprinkle with additional powdered sugar just before serving.
