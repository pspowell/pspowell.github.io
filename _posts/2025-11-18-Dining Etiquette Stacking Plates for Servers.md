# 🍽️ Dining Etiquette: Stacking Plates for Servers

When dining out, many guests want to help servers and bussers by stacking plates. While the gesture is kind, there are best practices to make sure it’s actually helpful.

## ✅ Do's
- Stack **big plates on the bottom, small plates on top**.
- Place **utensils and trash on the top plate**, not between plates.
- Keep stacks **stable and not too tall**.
- Stack **empty or nearly empty cups only**, never with liquid inside.
- Use utensils to weigh down napkins so they don’t blow away.
- Stack dishes **away from the wall**, so servers don’t have to reach awkwardly or climb over to grab them.
- In casual or busy restaurants, thoughtful stacking is often appreciated.

## 🚫 Don’ts
- Don’t put **napkins or trash inside glasses** — it’s messy and hard to clean.
- Don’t place **silverware between plates** — it spreads grease and food residue.
- Don’t stack **glassware** — it can break or get stuck together.
- Don’t scrape **all food/garbage onto one plate** — it creates a mess.
- Don’t stack before **everyone at the table is finished eating** — in fine dining, this is considered improper.
- Don’t assume your stacking system matches the server’s — sometimes it’s best to leave it to them.

## 🌟 Key Takeaway
Stacking plates is a kind gesture in casual settings if done carefully. In fine dining, it’s better to let staff handle it. The universal rule: **never put trash or napkins in cups**.
